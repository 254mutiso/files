            <marquee> <p>Israel has ordered the entire population of northern Gaza to evacuate south, a warning that leaves more than 1 million people to decide whether to abandon their homes. Hamas urged Gazans to ignore it.
                Following the order, 70 people — mostly women and children — were killed after Israeli airstrikes hit convoys of Palestinian evacuees heading south in Gaza.
                Israel's military said the order, which has raised fears of an imminent ground offensive on the densely populated enclave, was intended to minimize civilian casualties in the war against Hamas. But the United Nations said it was "impossible" and risked a humanitarian disasterPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a surprise statement on Israeli television tonight, saying the country's forces were preparing for another attack in Gaza and "our enemies have only started paying the price."
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as the U.S. grapples with its response to the surprise Hamas attack and the fate of Americans, including some taken hostage.
                At least 1,300 people — including 258 soldiers — have been killed in Israel and more than 3,300 have been injured. In Gaza, at least 1,900 people have been killed and more than 7,600 have been injured.
                Tens of thousands of people protested across the Middle East after Friday prayers today.
                NBC News’ Lester Holt, Richard Engel, Raf Sanchez, Kelly Cobiella, Matt Bradley, Ellison Barber, Chantal Da Silva and Josh Lederman are reporting from the region..</p></marquee>
